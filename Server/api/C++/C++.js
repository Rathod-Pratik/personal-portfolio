explanation: "A virtual function in C++ is a member function declared in a base class that you expect to override in derived classes. It enables polymorphism, allowing the program to determine the correct function to call at runtime based on the type of the object being pointed to or referenced, rather than the type of the pointer or reference itself. This is achieved through a mechanism called the virtual table (vtable), which keeps track of the virtual functions for each class.", topics: [ "Declaration and Syntax: A virtual function is declared in a base class using the virtual keyword before the function's return type. For example: virtual void show();. It can be overridden in any derived class, providing specific functionality.", "Dynamic Binding: Virtual functions support dynamic binding (also known as late binding), meaning that the decision about which function to call is made at runtime based on the object's actual type rather than the type of the pointer/reference used to invoke the function.", "Polymorphism: The use of virtual functions is fundamental to achieving polymorphism in C++. This allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class, providing flexibility in programming and enabling more general and reusable code.", "Overriding: When a derived class redefines a virtual function, it is said to override the base class implementation. The derived class version will be called when the function is invoked on an object of that derived class, even if accessed via a base class pointer or reference.", "Destructor and Virtual Functions: If a class has virtual functions, it is advisable to declare its destructor as virtual as well. This ensures that when an object is deleted through a base class pointer, the derived class's destructor is called, allowing for proper cleanup of resources." ]
