When creating a cookie, you can specify its name, value, expiration date, path, domain, and security attributes (like Secure and HttpOnly).", "Retrieving Cookies: Cookies can be accessed through the document.cookie property, which returns all cookies associated with the current document as a single string. Developers often need to parse this string to retrieve individual cookie values.", "Expiration and Lifespan: Cookies can have an expiration date set using the expires attribute, determining how long the cookie should be stored. If no expiration is set, the cookie is treated as a session cookie and will be deleted when the browser is closed.", "Secure and HttpOnly Cookies: The Secure attribute ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS, enhancing security, while the HttpOnly attribute prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.", "Cookie Size Limitations: Most browsers impose size limits on cookies (typically around 4KB per cookie), as well as limits on the total number of cookies that can be stored per domain.
